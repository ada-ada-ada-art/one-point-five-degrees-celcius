# One Point Five Degrees Celcius

## What is this?

This project is the code for Ada Ada Ada's generative art piece One Point Five Degrees Celcius, released on [https://www.fxhash.xyz/generative/10011](fxhash in February 2022).

The piece features 128 quotes from the infamous IPCC Report on the consequences of Global Warming of 1.5Â°C.

To symbolize how climate science gets distorted by politicians, companies and other entities in power, each edition features one quote, surrounded by unique chaotic shapes, colors and glitchy effects, all attempting to distract from the clear scientific conclusions.

The piece adjusts to different screen sizes, so it's recommended to try adjusting the browser window. 

This project is made with Typescript, [https://p5js.org/](p5.js), [https://meodai.github.io/fettepalette/](FettePalette) and the font [https://rsms.me/inter/](Inter by Rasmus Andersson).

## Why is this open source?

For two reasons:

1. To spread awareness of the Climate Strike License.
2. To share the algorithm that fits text and shapes to the canvas in a nice way
